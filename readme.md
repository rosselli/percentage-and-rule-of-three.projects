# Percentage and Rule Of Three

+ "Percentage" is the **result obtained by multiplying a quantity by a percent**, so 10 percent of 50 apples is 5 apples: the **5 apples is the percentage**.
    + **Y** _(5 apples)_
    + **P** _(10%)_
    + **X** _(50 apples)_ 

## Basic Formula
```X/Y = P*100```

## Basic Problems
+ Find **P** percent of **X**
+ Find what percent of **X** is **Y**
+ Find **X** if **P** percent of it is **Y**


## Variations
+ **Y** _(Percent)_
+ **P** _(Percentage)_
+ **X** _(Total)_ 

### ```Y = (P/100) * X```
+ **P** percent of **X** is what? _(5% of 29 is 1.45)_
+ What is **P** percent of **X**? _(10% of 25 is 2.5)_
+ What of **X** is **P** percent? _(2.75 of 25 is 11%)_

### ```P = (Y/X) * 100```
+ **Y** is what percent of **X**? _(12 is 30% of 40)_
+ **Y** of **X** is what percent? _(9 of 13 is 69.23%)_
+ What percent of **X** is **Y**? _(22.22% of 27 is 6)_

###```X = Y/(P/100)```
+ **Y** is **P** percent of what? _(9 is 60% of 15)_
+ **Y** of what is **P** percent? _(4 of 33.3333 is 12%)_
+ **P** percent of what is **Y**? _(20% of 35 is 7)_


# Rule Of Three
+ It that allows you to solve problems **based on proportions**.

## Basic Formula
```A/B = C/X```
